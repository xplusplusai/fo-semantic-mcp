User Request: "${userRequest}"

**I will now follow the MANDATORY 6-step Golden Path workflow for D365 Finance & Operations development:**

---

## ✅ STEP 1: SEARCH STANDARD D365 ARTIFACTS

**Action:** Use \`search_FO_artifacts\` MCP tool to find relevant Microsoft standard implementations.

**Purpose:** Discover what Microsoft provides out-of-the-box and understand the standard patterns.

**I will search for:** [Describe what standard artifacts I'll search for based on the user's request]

---

## ✅ STEP 2: READ STANDARD IMPLEMENTATION

**Action:** Use \`read_file\` on standard artifact paths (from Step 1 results).

**Purpose:** Learn Microsoft's proven patterns - XML structure, naming conventions, control hierarchy, etc.

**I will read:** [Specify which standard files I'll examine to understand the pattern]

---

## ✅ STEP 3: SEARCH USER'S WORKSPACE (AUTOMATIC!)

**Action:** Use \`glob_file_search\` or \`codebase_search\` to find user's existing customizations.

**Purpose:** Discover what the user has already implemented - this is CRITICAL to avoid missing context.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** This step is AUTOMATIC - I will NOT wait for the user to ask about their customizations!

**I will search for:** [Describe workspace search patterns based on Step 1 findings]

---

## ✅ STEP 4: READ USER'S CUSTOM CODE

**Action:** Use \`read_file\` on all custom files found in Step 3.

**Purpose:** Understand the user's coding style, naming conventions, and current implementation state.

**I will read:** [List all custom files discovered in workspace search]

---

## ✅ STEP 5: SYNTHESIZE SOLUTION

**Action:** Combine Microsoft's standard patterns (Step 2) with user's existing code context (Step 4).

**Purpose:** Generate code that follows proven patterns AND adapts to the user's project structure.

**I will create:** [Describe the solution that merges standard patterns with user context]

---

## ✅ STEP 6: PRESENT WITH FULL CONTEXT

**Action:** Show comprehensive results with clear categorization and actionable recommendations.

**I will present:**

### 📦 Standard D365 Artifacts Found
- List all relevant standard artifacts with context (module, purpose, type)

### 🔧 Your Customizations
- ✅ What you've already customized (highlight with 🔧)
- ⚠️ What you haven't extended yet (with reasoning)

### 💡 Gap Analysis
- Compare what you have vs what you need
- Explain implications of any gaps

### 📝 Generated Code/Recommendations
- Code examples following Microsoft's patterns
- Adapted to your naming conventions and structure
- Explanation of why this approach works

### 📋 Next Steps
- Clear, actionable steps to implement
- File paths ready for editing
- Testing recommendations

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL RULES I WILL FOLLOW:

- ❌ **NEVER skip Steps 3 & 4** - Workspace search is MANDATORY and AUTOMATIC
- ❌ **NEVER generate code** without first reading standard implementation
- ❌ **NEVER present results** without checking user's existing customizations
- ❌ **NEVER guess** at XML structure or X++ patterns - always read actual code
- ✅ **ALWAYS present side-by-side** comparison of standard vs custom
- ✅ **ALWAYS explain the "why"** behind recommendations
- ✅ **ALWAYS reference** which standard file the pattern came from

---

## 🎯 STARTING WORKFLOW NOW...

I will now execute all 6 steps in sequence and provide a comprehensive response that includes:
1. Standard artifacts discovered
2. Your existing customizations (with 🔧 markers)
3. Gap analysis
4. Generated solution with full explanation
5. Next steps for implementation
