  "body": "## ðŸ”§ v1.2.1 - Critical Threshold Fix\n\n**Resolved**: Fixed threshold settings that were filtering out exact matches. Updated all examples to use 0.5 threshold for reliable foName filter functionality.\n\n### Fixed\n- **Default Threshold**: Lowered from 0.75 to 0.5 for better result balance\n- **foName Filter Issues**: Fixed exact matches being filtered out by high thresholds\n- **Configuration Examples**: Updated all examples to use proven 0.5 threshold\n- **AI Instructions**: Enhanced guidance for threshold usage with foName filter\n\n### Enhanced\n- **Adaptive Strategy**: Updated to 0.5 â†’ 0.4 â†’ 0.3 â†’ no threshold progression\n- **Debug Logging**: Added request/response logging for troubleshooting\n- **Documentation**: Comprehensive foName filter usage examples\n\n### Why This Fix Matters\nThe original 0.75 threshold was too restrictive and filtered out exact artifact matches even when using the foName filter. This patch ensures reliable exact matching while maintaining semantic search quality.\n\n### Download & Installation\n1. Download the latest release and extract it anywhere on your system\n2. Get your API key from: **https://www.xplusplus.ai/**\n3. Configure your MCP client (Cursor IDE, Claude Desktop, VS Code)\n4. Use the provided `fo-semantic-mcp-win.cmd` launcher for Windows or `node dist/server.js` for other platforms\n\n### Configuration Update Required\nIf upgrading from v1.2.0, update your MCP client configuration to use threshold 0.5:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"env\": {\n    \"FO_SEARCH_DEFAULT_THRESHOLD\": \"0.5\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Perfect for F&O developers, consultants, and architects building extensions and understanding existing implementations!**",
